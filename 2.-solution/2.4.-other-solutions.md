# 2.4. Other Solutions

The [last section](2.3.-for-buyers-and-sellers.md) explains specific solutions for issues that both buyers and sellers are current experiencing with NFT marketplaces available today. This section will address other various NFT marketplace issues as a whole.

### 2.4.1. Mobile App

**GRYPH** will provide buyers both a web and mobile application to interact with the site. This special mobile application can be treated like any other wallet application with the exception of being dedicated to NFTs. Buyers with NFTs no longer need to import their NFT manually. Instead the mobile application will sync with the web version automatically. Buyers will be even able to list, sell and collect easier on the mobile application.

### 2.4.2. Security

With the growth of NFT marketplaces the increase of bad actors in the space is growing. To combat this the NFT marketplace will be one of the few where security will be paramount. We will hire a **CISO** to oversee the cybersecurity system. The cybersecurity system will have AI and Machine learning to investigate trends within the system. This technology added to our platform will make **GRYPH** one of the most secure marketplaces in the NFT marketplace space.

### 2.4.3. Theft

Sadly NFT art theft is common in the NFT marketplace. It has been estimated that 90% of the art posted on the **OpenSea** platform was art that were stolen and sold to unsuspected buyers. To address this issue **OpenSea** tried to change a policy in regards to how many pieces a collector can implement in the platform at one time to bad reviews. **DeviantArt** has implemented a fraud alert system that scans the **Ethereum** blockchain for NFT copies of work.

On Feb 20th, 2022 owners of high-value NFTs were having their **Opensea**-listed assets pulled out from under them by [an unknown attacker](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3E0DeFb880cd8e163baD68ABe66437f99A7A8A74). Either the new **Opensea** contract was hacked, or users were hit by a phishing attack. This is another way of theft on the **OpenSea** marketplace.

Any users who interacted with **Openseaâ€™s** new contracts had to revoke token approvals from **Opensea**. [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker) and [Revoke.cash](https://revoke.cash) both provide interfaces for this, but customers were experiencing intense server load. OpenSea told customers to use whichever service will load for their customers.

The outgoing transactions were caused by an attacker who had an **OpenSea** account and an attack contract. At the time of this post the attacker held 641.5 ETH liquid, and many high-ticket NFTs, including 17 Azuki, 3 BAYC, 2 Cool Cats, and 2 Mutant Ape Yacht Clubs. The attacker also pocketed a racial slur ENS name, for the cherry on top.

The customers of **OpenSea** have fallen prey to a phishing scam. The attacker has likely struck on Feb 20th as the phished listings are expiring soon with the Opensea contract migration.

This scenario on **OpenSea** could of been avoided and detected with the right amount of forward thinking and security. The **GRYPH** marketplace will work with fraud systems and user accountability. If an artist complains about an NFT that is launched on our platform we will pull the NFT in question off our platform until an investigation is completed. At that time we will ask the artist in question and the artist that requested the investigation proof of authenticity.

If there is a situation that does not look normal in our system the AI and machine learning in the cybersecurity system will send a notice to the security/IT team for an investigation. The **CISO** will be contacted and will have a plan in place to combat such an scenario. Your investment is paramount at **GRYPH**. We will not take your business for granted.
