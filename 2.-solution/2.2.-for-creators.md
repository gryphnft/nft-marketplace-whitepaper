# 2.2. For Creators

The [last section](./2.1.-overview.md) talked about the platform's goal of being a universal cross chain NFT marketplace. This section will explain specific solutions for issues creators are currently experiencing with other NFT marketplaces. 

The available solutions today made to trade digital assets are currently very limited in terms of what blockchain they support with the inability to conform to new and upcoming NFT standards like batch minting and multiple royalties. Additionally, while some platforms do support creating NFT collections, creators are usually locked into their smart contract, cannot detach their collection and thus cannot relist in other marketplaces. Lastly, marketplaces have minimal support features that creators can use in their NFT launch past the creation of their collection.

When a collection is made with GRYPH, a new industry standard smart contract will be deployed and ownership will be passed back to the creator. The platform will include standard templates and further allow the creator to customize. These templates are completely white labeled and will inherently allow creators to list their same collection on different marketplaces.

* Standard art collection
* Art and editions
* Genart art collection
* Game items Videos and editions
* Songs and editions
* 3D interactive art Interactive art/items
* Import collection
* Memes

> **NOTE**: This implies the creator must pay for the gas to deploy the contract

For creators seeking assistance to fund the gas cost on their preferred blockchain, the platform will provide an interface for individuals, groups or DAOs to assess and assist through the blockchain. For paying gas with another coin, the platform will integrate with different swaps.

Creators can upload their file assets through the platform to IPFS for free. Each file will have an upload limitation of 1GB. Creators can customize the sale features depending on the chosen template. The following sale features will be available on the platform.

* Presale date, price
* Reveal date, price
* Max supply
* Whitelist allocations, price
* Multiple royalties using a payment splitter

Depending on the contract support created or imported, the platform can provide APIs and embed scripts that creators can paste on a website and interact with the GRYPH completely whitelabeled. One of these scripts can be used to promote an NFT sale on an external website like the following.

> **NOTE:** You donâ€™t need to create a new or import an existing collection. The platform will auto detect new NFTs from the blockchain automatically.

GRYPH will also provide integrations and documentation for creators to easily launch their own NFT marketplace on a website.
