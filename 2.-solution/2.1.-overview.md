One general direction that will attract a wider audience to the platform will be the support on every Ethereum based blockchain as well as Solana. Users can simply change their wallet network to activate it.

Other directions focus on each kind of user in the NFT ecosystem which comprises creators, buyers sellers, promoters, and stakers. Each of these roles currently suffers from their own issues.

* **Creators -** How to launch NFTs? How to set up royalties? How to list the same collection in different marketplaces? How to facilitate my initial sale?
* **Buyers** - How to buy my first NFT? How to get notified of hot NFT projects before the initial sale? How to validate a collection? How to join a community? How to buy from a different blockchain? How to make an offer on an entire collection?
* **Sellers -** How to list on multiple marketplaces? How to trade/barter NFTs?
