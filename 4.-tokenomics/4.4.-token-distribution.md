# 4.4. Token Distribution

The purpose of this token distribution strategy is to avoid inflation early on by limiting the maximum token quantity to one billion tokens (1,000,000,000 $GRYPH). The purpose of this vesting strategy is to prevent the undervalue of $GRYPH during the required development time of the platform. This is why every party under this vesting arrangement will start receiving $GRYPH starting after six months and spread over two years (0.5 - 2 years vesting).

The purpose of the distributing tokens to each of these underlying sectors are outlined below.

* **Private Sale** - Vesting as compensation for activating the project&#x20;
* **Public Sale** - Vesting as compensation for supporting the long term goals of this project&#x20;
* **Team** - To incentivize the team to persistently work towards increasing the value of their tokens over time.&#x20;
* **Marketing** - To vest key influencers and media that incentivize them to promote the project.
* **Partnerships** - To vest key partnerships that incentivize them to work with the platform early on.&#x20;
* **Treasury** - The initial amount that will be distributed to the Economy Engine&#x20;
* **Liquidity** - The amount that will be distributed to exchanges, swaps and hot liquidity for the platform

Every person under these sales, team, marketing, partnerships will incrementally start receiving $GRYPH automatically after the first six months (180 days). Treasury and Liquidity will be minted and receive their allocation as soon as there is a smart contract to receive these funds. The following chart visualizes this token emission schedule.
