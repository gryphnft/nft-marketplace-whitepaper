# 4.2. Token Utility

First the seller would need to use $GRYPH to list their NFT for sale. Since the side chain only deals with marketplace related transactions the gas fees should be relatively minimal. A similar token utility can be found in play to earn games like Axie Infinity and Decentraland.

Once the NFT is listed, a buyer can purchase the NFT and two percent (2%) will be deducted from the purchase value as a listing and transaction fee back to the platform and will send $GRYPH rewards to both the buyer and seller. The amount of rewards given are dependent on the purchase amount.

> **NOTE:** An example purchase amounting to 1 ETH would reward 100 $GRYPH split between the buyer and seller and another purchase of 10 ETH would reward 1,000 $GRYPH.

Buyers and sellers can also use $GRYPH to offset the listing and transaction fees. when a buyer purchases. This implies that the seller would need to deposit enough tokens when listing in order to receive one-hundred percent of the purchase value. Sellers can decide how much tokens to use when listing.

> **NOTE**: If a listing fee costs 100 GRYPH, and the seller deposits 50 GRYPH, then the listing fee will only be 1%.

> **NOTE**: Buyers and sellers can accumulate $GRYPH in order to save on larger purchases

### 4.2.1. Minting with GRYPH

Creators can mint on their preferred blockchain using the platform for at no additional cost, however will still be subject to their respective gas fees. Creators that choose to mint their NFT collection on the GRYPH side chain will benefit from having zero platform fees in the secondary market. This means GRYPH will not charge a listing nor transaction fee for NFTs on their own chain.

### 4.2.2. Platform Programs

The following programs describe other ways that $GRYPH can be consumed.

#### Staking $GRYPH

Help the ecosystem buy NFTs with any crypto-currency and earn from the transaction fees. Earn more by staking GRYPH pairs.

#### Staking NFT Projects

Fund NFT projects and earn rewards from their primary sale.

#### Launch Parties

Get invited to exclusive launch parties based on the amount of GRYPH you are holding.

#### Referrals

NFT creators can set a reward for referring buyers to their primary sale.

#### Bug Bounty

Find a bug in the platform and earn. Rewards are graded by severity. NFT projects with custom contracts can also list a bounty and their own rewards.

### 4.2.3. Economics

Behind the platform, lies an economy engine used to determine the price of $GRYPH relative to the blockchain it lives in (the “Engine”). To make this less confusing, ETH will be used to explain the examples within this section. GRYPH uses this Engine similar to how paid-in capital is used to determine the value of corporate shares.

![Economy Engine Overview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120378/154844317-1ae0fde8-1477-4028-b316-61a9d277d611.png)

> **NOTE:** If GRYPH initially deposited 1,000 ETH as “paid-in”, then to calculate the value per token is simply 1,000 ETH / MAX SUPPLY.

When capital is sent to the Engine, it prices $GRYPH value by what it is willing to buy tokens for and sell tokens for automatically. If more capital is added, the prices would rise and if capital was removed then the price would fall. The example dataset below models how $GRYPH would be priced at any given time and how the Engine gains capital over time.

Since $GRYPH is backed by assets in the Engine (the “**Treasury**”), it inherently kind of controls what the suggested price should be while allowing room for speculative trading. It would not make any sense for a seller to list $GRYPH below what the Engine is willing to buy it for and likewise above what it is willing to sell it for. At the same time, the suggested price thresholds by no means are reasonably priced. This means both buyers and sellers will always have an advantage over the engine as long as the exchanges are happening between the thresholds.

In the example above, if a holder makes a sell order for 0.3 ETH, a buyer would see that’s a good deal compared to the Engine’s sell order for 0.5 ETH. Likewise, when a holder makes a buy order of 0.3 ETH, a seller should see that’s also a good deal compared to the Engine’s buy order of 0.1 ETH.

In an extreme case, if everyone lists their tokens under the buy back price, the Engine would just buy every token, leaving everyone else with no other option than to buy it for the Engine’s selling price. Oppositely if all $GRYPH were distributed out, then the Engine would just wait for someone to sell it for the Engine’s buy back price.

The platform uses this Engine to determine what the listing and transaction fees should be. Whenever an NFT is sold, the platform fees are sent to this Engine in exchange for tokens to be awarded to both the buyer and seller. If $GRYPH was used to offset the fees, then $GRYPH is sent to the Engine in exchange for the native cryptocurrency. Based on this logic the Engine can calculate the rewards and fees in gryph with the following formulas.

> **GRYPH FEES** = (ETH CAPITAL / MAX SUPPLY \* 200%) \* (NFT ETH LISTING \* 2%)\
> **GRYPH REWARDS** = (ETH CAPITAL / MAX SUPPLY \* 50%) \* (NFT ETH LISTING \* 2%)

Overall $GRYPH is also used as gas fees for the marketplace. With that said, GRYPH is planning to eventually cap the price if it ever reaches above two dollars ($2) in order to keep these gas fees reasonably priced.
