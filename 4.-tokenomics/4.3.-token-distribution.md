# 4.3. Token Distribution

The [last section](4.3.-token-distribution.md) covered the basics of the **$GRYPH** token utility, other possible token rewards and the economics behind the token itself. This section will explain the token distribution strategies, rationale, and how the **GRYPH** team plans to self-regulate their spending.

The purpose of this token distribution strategy is to avoid inflation early on by limiting the maximum token quantity to one billion tokens _(1,000,000,000 $GRYPH)_. The purpose of this vesting strategy is to prevent the undervalue of **$GRYPH** during the required development time of the platform. This is why every party under this vesting arrangement will start receiving $GRYPH starting after six months and spread over two years (0.5 - 2 years vesting).

The purpose of the distributing tokens to each of these underlying sectors are outlined below.

* **Community Staking** - Vesting as compensation for activating and supporting the long term goals of this project.
* **Team** - To incentivize the team to persistently work towards increasing the value of their tokens over time.
* **Marketing** - To vest key influencers and media that incentivize them to promote the project.
* **Partnerships** - To vest key partnerships that incentivize them to work with the platform early on.
* **Treasury** - The initial amount that will be distributed to the Economy Engine
* **Liquidity** - The amount that will be distributed to exchanges, swaps and hot liquidity for the platform

Every person under these sales, team, marketing, partnerships will incrementally start receiving **$GRYPH** automatically after the first six months (180 days). Treasury and Liquidity will be minted and receive their allocation as soon as there is a smart contract to receive these funds. The following chart visualizes this token emission schedule.

Focusing on the data model explained in the [token utility](4.2.-token-utility.md#data-model) section, the Treasury _(of 200M)_ will be allocated to the Economy Engine, and the Liquidity _(of 200M)_ will be first used to cover the initial **$GRYPH** rewards as a _gasless hot swap_ in the platform.

## 4.3.1. Token Sale Mechanics

The sale will occur in one stage, Community Staking. All token holders including team, marketing, and partnerships will be entered into a vesting contract that distributes tokens overtime. The contracts that support this vesting arrangement will be deployed before and after these stages are the paid-in, multisig and vesting contracts for private, public and team.

* **Paid-In Contract** - The core of the Economy Engine that backs the value of **$GRYPH** with crypto assets stored in the same contract; It is a built-in internal exchange used to determine the listing fees and transaction fees of the platform.
* **Multisig Contract** - Used to fund the manual operations of the platform with built-in levels of approvals and request cooldowns; Used to self-regulate the actual spend of the operations through transparency and automation.
* **Vesting Contracts** - The contracts used to automatically vest a cohort with programmed rules of when and how much a person can release tokens at any given time.

The funds collected from community staking will be sent straight to the paid-in and the multisig. The token sale contracts will only send funds to the paid-in and multisig and can be verified on the blockchain before purchasing.

Fifty percent (50%) of these funds will be distributed to the paid-in contract. At the same time, the entire **$GRYPH** Treasury allocation will be minted and held in the same contract. Both the funds and the Treasury backs the value of **$GRYPH** and automatically sets the sell and buy back amounts for the platform.

![How Funds Gets Distributed Hands Free](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120378/154844628-02c0cd24-f242-4b2e-8e26-e9d966c4485e.png)

The rest of funds will be transferred to a multisig wallet with rules resembling a corporate board enforcing the transparency of the project with several layers of approval. With this contract, authorized vendors can request for funds and will require a certain number of approvals based on the amount requested. When a request is approved, a similar request amount cannot be approved based on the last amount requested for some period of time determined by the contract.

![Multisig Model](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120378/154844654-06d2396c-5751-447c-bc22-fa28098e2d89.png)

The following table describes the rules the code will follow and an example of the max withdrawal possible per month. When a request has been fully approved, the funds will automatically be transferred to the recipient.

If community staking funds were fully allocated, it would take over a year (15 months) to extract all of the funds from this multisig arrangement and **$GRYPH** holders could audit how these funds were spent through blockchain transactions.

## 4.3.2. Community Staking

The purpose of community staking is to validate the projectâ€™s thesis (the "**STAKING**"). The whitelist to join the Staking will be posted on our website.  All whitelist participants will be required to join our Discord channel.  Once the Staking begins we will release 1,000,000 tokens at our lowest price per token.  To keep interested parties invested in the sale, GRYPH will sell tokens and at each token sale drop the price will be dictated at the discretion of the community. \
\
The approach is to keep the community engaged and to let the said community dictate the price of the next token drop to be staked.  At the end of each increment of tokens released for sale the next increment will be priced at the discretion of the community by vote.  The community will be given two options, the current rate or a higher rate. This will keep the people on the whitelist engaged with our sale, plus give others the chance to come in.  \


> **NOTE**:  This will give the early participants the opportunity to see their portfolio grow, while giving others the chance to join in the Staking. If you are in the first batch of participants with the token at 0.000005 for example.  You will want to raise the rate at the next drop for the next increment of tokens to guarantee the growth of your token portfolio.  The community will dictate the pace of the sale and the rate during this process.  Once the pace of the sale slows down. The sale will stop. Therefore in theory all 300,000,000 tokens allotted for this sale can be distributed as quickly as the community dictates.\

At the end of this period, if less than thirty percent (30%) of **$GRYPH** allocation has been sold, then **GRYPH** will start the refunding process. The following general information summarizes this community staking process.

If the activation requirements have been reached, the funds will be used to deploy contracts, activate key personnel, marketing and to start development of the platform.
