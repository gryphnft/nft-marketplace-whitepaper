# 4.3. Token Distribution

The purpose of this token distribution strategy is to avoid inflation early on by limiting the maximum token quantity to one billion tokens (1,000,000,000 $GRYPH). The purpose of this vesting strategy is to prevent the undervalue of $GRYPH during the required development time of the platform. This is why every party under this vesting arrangement will start receiving $GRYPH starting after six months and spread over two years (0.5 - 2 years vesting).

The purpose of the distributing tokens to each of these underlying sectors are outlined below.

* **Private Sale** - Vesting as compensation for activating the project&#x20;
* **Public Sale** - Vesting as compensation for supporting the long term goals of this project&#x20;
* **Team** - To incentivize the team to persistently work towards increasing the value of their tokens over time.&#x20;
* **Marketing** - To vest key influencers and media that incentivize them to promote the project.
* **Partnerships** - To vest key partnerships that incentivize them to work with the platform early on.&#x20;
* **Treasury** - The initial amount that will be distributed to the Economy Engine&#x20;
* **Liquidity** - The amount that will be distributed to exchanges, swaps and hot liquidity for the platform

Every person under these sales, team, marketing, partnerships will incrementally start receiving $GRYPH automatically after the first six months (180 days). Treasury and Liquidity will be minted and receive their allocation as soon as there is a smart contract to receive these funds. The following chart visualizes this token emission schedule.

## 4.3.1. Token Sale Mechanics

The sale will occur in two stages, the Private Sale and the Public Sale. All token holders including team, marketing, and partnerships will be entered into a vesting contract that distributes tokens overtime. The contracts that support this vesting arrangement will be deployed before and after these stages are the paid-in, multisig and vesting contracts for private, public and team.

* **Paid-In Contract** - The core of the Economy Engine that backs the value of $GRYPH with crypto assets stored in the same contract; It is a built-in internal exchange used to determine the listing fees and transaction fees of the platform.
* **Multisig Contract** - Used to fund the manual operations of the platform with built-in levels of approvals and request cooldowns; Used to self-regulate the actual spend of the operations through transparency and automation.
* **Vesting Contracts** - The contracts used to automatically vest a cohort with programmed rules of when and how much a person can release tokens at any given time.

The funds collected from both the private and public sale will be sent straight to the paid-in and the multisig. The token sale contracts will only send funds to the paid-in and multisig and can be verified on the blockchain before purchasing.

Fifty percent (50%) of these funds will be distributed to the paid-in contract. At the same time, the entire $GRYPH Treasury allocation will be minted and held in the same contract. Both the funds and the Treasury backs the value of $GRYPH and automatically sets the sell and buy back amounts for the platform.

The rest of funds will be transferred to a multisig wallet with rules resembling a corporate board enforcing the transparency of the project with several layers of approval. With this contract, authorized vendors can request for funds and will require a certain number of approvals based on the amount requested. When a request is approved, a similar request amount cannot be approved based on the last amount requested for some period of time determined by the contract.

![Multisig Model](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120378/154844654-06d2396c-5751-447c-bc22-fa28098e2d89.png)

The following table describes the rules the code will follow and an example of the max withdrawal possible per month. When a request has been fully approved, the funds will automatically be transferred to the recipient.

If both the private and public sale funds were fully allocated, it would take over a year (15 months) to extract all of the funds from this multisig arrangement and $GRYPH holders could audit how these funds were spent through blockchain transactions.

## 4.3.2. Private Sale

The purpose of the private sale is to validate the project’s thesis. At the end of this period, if less than thirty percent (30%) of $GRYPH allocation has been sold, then GRYPH will start the refunding process. The following general information summarizes this private sale.

If the activation requirements have been reached, the funds will be used to deploy contracts, activate key personnel, marketing for the public sale and to start development of the platform.

## 4.3.3. Public Sale

The purpose of the public sale is to secure the funding needed to continue developments and operations past the platform’s minimal viable product. The following general information summarizes this public sale.
