# 1.1. ABSTRACT

**GRYPH** is an NFT marketplace that allows digital assets to be listed and traded across all major blockchains redefining how creators publish digital artworks and buyers purchase easier.

Only a handful of NFT marketplaces exist that service a general audience. These marketplaces usually support one or two blockchain networks and are designed around proof-of-concept rather than ease-of-use. Less popular blockchains while supporting NFTs do not have an NFT marketplace that supports them.

**GRYPH** will solve these deficiencies by supporting every ethereum based blockchain as well as Solana and Flow. Creators can create and customize their collections built on top of industry standard smart contracts. Sellers can list NFTs with extremely low gas fees. Buyers can purchase NFTs from different blockchains automatically, built on top of swaps.

The **$GRYPH** token is used throughout the marketplace. It will be consumed in a side chain as gas fees, given out as rewards for every successful purchase to both the buyer and sell split evenly, and can be used to offset the listing fee.
