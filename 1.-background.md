# 1. BACKGROUND

The NFT industry started with OpenSea, an NFT marketplace, and CryptoKitties, one of the first popular NFT collections both being launched in 2017. Today NFTs have grown past the creative arts category into sports, music, videos, properties, and games. Innovators are developing ways to connect the physical world with the metaverse using NFTs as the official passport. Social media companies like Facebook and Twitter are also discovering ways to incorporate NFTs as a feature within their platform.

Despite these ongoing developments, only a handful of NFT marketplaces that exist today service a general audience. These marketplaces trade over twenty billion dollars in volumes every month and earn on average two percent (2%) in listing fees.

4. Purchasing an NFT from a different blockchain or with wETH
5. Showing the NFT in their wallet
