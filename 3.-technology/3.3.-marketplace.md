![Using Side Chain to Lower Gas Fees](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120378/154844227-f2e39c50-52c7-47a7-83e2-622b49492fae.png)

This process flow has been used in play to earn games like Axie Infinity and Decentraland. We are simply repurposing the existing technology in this project. A side chain will be used to address gas costs when listing and purchasing NFTs.

> **NOTE:** A sidechain is a separate blockchain that is attached to its parent blockchain using a two-way peg. The two-way peg enables interchangeability of assets at a predetermined rate between the parent blockchain and the sidechain. The original blockchain is usually referred to as the ‘main chain’ and all additional blockchains are referred to as ‘sidechains’.

The following sections describe the different approaches to achieve affordable listing and purchasing using blockchain technologies.

### 3.4.1. Approach 1 - The Vaults

The seller will need to fill out the listing information on the platform and deposit their NFT into a vault. Buyers can then deposit their crypto to a similar vault. Next the buyer can then purchase the NFT for the listed price and terms. Finally both the seller and buyer can withdraw their respective crypto and NFT.

### 3.4.2. Approach 2 - Approvals and Allowances

The seller will need to fill out the listing information on the platform and give approval to GRYPH to escrow their NFT. Buyers can then give GRYPH an allowance to be used for the purchase of the NFT. Finally both the seller and buyer can withdraw their respective crypto and NFT.

### 3.4.3. Approach 3 - Cross Chain Escrow

The side chain will be able to communicate with the blockchain using a bridge or a dedicated cross chain like Chain Link or BitTorrent by setting child contracts in each supported blockchain.

### 3.4.4. Approach 4 - Cryptographic Receipts

The side chain will generate two cryptographic receipts for both the seller and buyer. The buyer can use their receipt to acquire the NFT on the blockchain. The seller can use their receipt to transfer funds to their wallet on the blockchain.
