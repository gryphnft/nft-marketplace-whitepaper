# 3.2. Contracts

## 3.2.1. Vesting Contracts

There will be several smart contracts designed to manage the distribution of tokens over time for participants. These smart contracts do not hold any tokens, but rather have the ability to mint tokens when released.

These contracts similarily have following vesting traits.

 * **Maximum Lock Period** - The time before the first set of tokens will be released.
 * **Vesting Date** - The time before all the tokens will be released.
 * **Unlock** - Allows the admin to unlock the tokens before the Maximum Lock Period.

Both of these contracts receive their initial funding from the private and public sale contracts. Both the private and public sale contracts will only release funds to these contracts. 

The Multisig is a contract designed to self-regulate the spend of the operations by requiring approvals based on the amount requested. It considers the following parameters.

 * **Request Amount** - The amount being requested.
 * **Number of Approvers Required** - The number of approvals required to release the requested amount.
 * **Cooldown** - The time that needs to elapse before another request is made.

The Paid-In Capital contract, is similar to a swap in that it accepts Ethereum and tokens to provide liquidity. The main differences is it sets a buy and sell amount based on the Ethereum and the supply of tokens it holds. This contract also is the underlying basis in which the fees are calculated on the platform.

## 3.2.3. Marketplace Contracts
