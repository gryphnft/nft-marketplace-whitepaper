# 3.3. Lazy Minting and Gasless Whitelisting

A cost effective approach to on-chain whitelisting is gasless whitelisting. Gasless whitelisting is the simple process of a contract owner giving the buyer a signed message they can submit to an NFT smart contract to verify and mint. The main benefits to gasless whitelisting is that the gas costs are charged one time to the buyer instead of twice and gas used is overall less than.

The difference between lazy minting and gasless whitelisting in this case when they are used. Whitelisting happens before the main token sale event and lazy minting happens during the mint. Lazy minting here is different from other marketplaces in this case because this platform supports the initial token sale. This stage is effectively separate from the secondary sale listings.
