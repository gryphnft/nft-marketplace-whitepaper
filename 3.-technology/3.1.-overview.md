# 3.1. Overview

The goal of this headless architecture is to push as much logic as possible to the browser and mobile application. It will use Metamask to authenticate users and use both Metamask and Moralis to communicate with the blockchain. Both the application and serverless functions will use Moralis to coordinate with IPFS, listen to blockchain events and access different blockchain cache.

The serverless components include Netlify to manage functions and CockroachDB as the primary data store. This data store will be primarily used for gasless transactions, contract templates, analytics and utility storage.
