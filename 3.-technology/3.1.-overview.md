# 3.1. Technology Overview

The goal of this headless architecture is to push as much logic as possible to the browser and mobile application. It will use **Metamask** to authenticate users and use both **Metamask** and **Moralis** to communicate with the blockchain. Both the application and serverless functions will use **Moralis** to coordinate with **IPFS**, listen to blockchain events and access different blockchain cache.

The serverless components include **Netlify** to manage functions and **CockroachDB** as the primary data store. This data store will be primarily used for gasless transactions, contract templates, analytics and utility storage.

The following sections cover more details of the technologies that will be implemented.
