# 3.2. Contract Templates

The following contracts will be initially available for creators. By default all will implement the ERC2981 Royalty standard.

 * **ERC721** - A vanilla NFT contract standard
 * **ERC721A** - NFT contract with lower gas fees when minting
 * **ERC721Collections** - NFT contract that supports editions of the same NFT
 * **BEP721** - Binance NFT contract standard 
 * **ERC1155** - NFT contract made for game items 

The platform will also detect utilities like Ownable and AccessControl and provide additional controls respectively. In later phases there will be a separate NFT contract marketplace that allows developers to include their standard and creators to consume it.
